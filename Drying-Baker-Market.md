Innovations in drying equipment that reduce energy consumption while maintaining product quality are expected to further enhance market growth. In addition, the rise of online bakery businesses and global distribution networks is anticipated to drive the demand for long-lasting, transport-friendly bakery products.</p> <p>Additionally, the increasing use of automated drying systems in large-scale commercial bakeries is expected to lower production costs, improving market accessibility and affordability.
