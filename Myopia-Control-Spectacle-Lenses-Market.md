Advances in lens technology, along with the rising awareness regarding myopia control, have driven the demand for specialized lenses designed to slow down the progression of myopia.

Increasing urbanization, sedentary lifestyles, and higher screen time have led to a surge in myopia cases, especially in children. This, in turn, is pushing the demand for myopia control lenses as a preventative measure. Additionally, advancements in lens materials, including myopia control designs like dual-focus, bifocal, and progressive lenses, offer improved results in slowing down the progression of myopia compared to traditional lenses.</p> <p>Another key growth driver is the rising popularity of ortho-k (orthokeratology) lenses and their integration with myopia control spectacles.
